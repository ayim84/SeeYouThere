# SeeYouThere

Everyday people are trying to find a meeting place that's convenient for all parties.  See You There is an application built using React.js that helps solve this problem.

It calculates the geographic center of the inputted locations and searches the Yelp API for businesses in the surrounding area.

This application was built using the [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app) npm package and GoogleMaps and Yelp APIs.

To find a central place to meet input an address or placenane into "Locations" field(s), select a category of business to search, then click the "Submit" button.  The Google Map will update showing the origin location(s) (blue marker(s)), the center point (red marker), and the 20 results returned by the Yelp API based on the calculated center point (green markers)).  The search results will appear in a column to the right of the map.

This application is a work in progress.  See deployed application [here](https://ayim84.github.io/SeeYouThere/).
